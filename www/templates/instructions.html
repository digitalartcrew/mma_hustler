        <div>
          MMA Hustler began in 2008 after training with soldiers and people all from across the world who had a passion for mixed martial arts training. While training in the desert, we discussed how difficult it was to make the commitment to be a full-time fighter, so we began sharing our skills and techniques with one another while growing as a brotherhood preserving the core principle of "just get a little better everyday".</b>
